# Welcome to Relay

Relay is a carpooling app designed for busy working parents to arrange rides for their children within a trusted community. Prioritizing **safety**, we offer a **reliable**, **transparent**, and **user-friendly** platform that simplifies carpooling through AI integration, real-time GPS tracking, route matching, and clear communication. By connecting parents with families whose children attend the same school or activities, Relay helps ensure transportation challenges don’t hinder children’s development while reducing stress for parents and promoting a more eco-friendly environment.
